## Description

This was a homework assignment where we built a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. We were tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Specifically, we used [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities.

## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.
